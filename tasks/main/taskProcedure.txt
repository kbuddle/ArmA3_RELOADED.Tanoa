per task procedure...

01. choose random location (forest/land/bridge/water/fuelstation/path/railway/road/runway/shipwreck/shore/transmitter/watertower)
02. choose 'roundabouts' location based from chosen random location (max 500m away from original chosen location)
03. choose random task
04. choose random task role (to complete the task... secure, destroy, arrest, rescue, steal, sabotage, etc)
05. choose random object for task role to be applied to (object or AI... arrest AI, destroy vehicle, etc)
06. choose random base composition (so. many. compositions.)
07. choose random number of random AI to spawn (each AI will have a different role... medic, engineer, autorifleman, aa specialist, etc)
08. choose random AI skill level per AI (every AI has a different skill level from... very low, low, regular, medium, high, elite)
09. choose random AI loadout (weapon/vest/backpack/etc) - not currently implemented
10. set task-multiplier to 0 (-1 = task failed, +1 = task success, will affect the overall AO progress)
11. set AI spawn-multiplier to 1 (6 AI spawn each 'loop' with a multiplier of 1, with the multiplier at 0.5 means only 3 AI will spawn for said task)
12. set AI skill-multiplier to 6 (each AI killed will decrease the multiplier for newly spawned AI units, meaning less skill per unit. 6 skillset levels)
