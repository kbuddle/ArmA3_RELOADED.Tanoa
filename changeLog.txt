09/05/2018
+ refactor code, changed a lot of code, variables, functions, strings, etc. stage one completed (took ~20hrs in total).

03/05/2018

+ changed admin zeus init, changed to a scripted zeus system based upon server side UID to allow access. makes it easy to add/remove zeus access without having to update the mission file.
+ updated object mapper, updated the way the base objects are spawned for tasks, which should hopefully prohibit task objects from exploding.
+ updated the way the ao is triggered (precompiled, should be faster).
+ updated random container loadout script. containers will no longer over-fill with contents.
+ updated player setup, added in sway coefficient to force 0.5 sway.
+ updated zeus modules for whitelist so global notifications are mute. added thermal vision modes to zeus views.

14/12/2017
+ changed blufor air defense area. blufor base air defense area is now up to 1500m from the center of the blufor base (see outer blue map marker), the ai 'praetorian 1c' will not engage unless 'air' enemy are inside this area (manually scripted).
+ added more lighting from blufor main base area towards/along the road to the diver spawn area.
+ removed 3d sound for 'no fire zones' (no more audible click, just a notification on screen).
+ updated bluFor base setup, added in 'no fire zone' for ALL autonomous vehicle turrets.
+ added UAV service script/function for both client and server. UAV's are now able to be serviced at the same service position as planes (can be seperated to it's own service point if needed).
+ updated unit markers script/function, added in revive pulse icon for units in incapacitated state (it will show for all players, not just medics).

+ updated deployment scripts/functions to delete vehicles if they are abandoned (eg, helicopter gets damaged and is forced to land, troop deploy/abandon helicopter).
+ fixed vehicle alarm for abandoned vehicles (alarm gives warning that vehicle is about to explode), alarm sound was local only, have now made it global to all connected players.
+ changed AO to task ratios again, rolled back the amount of heavy tasks by one and light tasks by one on a per AO basis (less simulated objects, hopefully better fps).
+ added building occupy script/function for deploying (temporary/non-respawnable) AI to within the enemy AO. every AO will have AI occupying random buildings.

+ changed server config entries to 'try' and fix the vanilla revive system (no idea if it will.. elp!).
+ added new RELOADED loading screen banner.
+ fixed error within COB script for proper AI deployment count (grounded and deployed).
+ changed DEBUG SPAM, debug spam (text and markers) are turned OFF. DEBUG STATS are still ON.
+ changed AI chosen skill-set levels, removed 'HIGH' skill-set for the time being (adjusting balance, needs feedback!)
+ changed AO to task ratios, rolled back the amount of heavy tasks and light tasks on a per AO basis (less simulated objects, hopefully better fps).
